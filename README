Text::Lossy
===========

This is a Perl 5 module which implements lossy text compression.
Specifically, it implements the "lossy" part to transform any text to a
form which is better compressible by standard entropy-based compression
algorithms.

Several different lossy text filters are supplied.

Is this a joke?
---------------

No, it's serious. Well, ok, partially serious â€“ I can't really see this
being used "in production", but it does what it says on the wrapper.
Every available filter preserves at least some of the readability and
comprehensibility of the text.

But the text stays the same length!
-----------------------------------

This module only supplies the entropy reduction via lossy transformation
of the text. This text is meant to be further processed by a lossless
compression, e.g. gzip, 7zip or similar.


INSTALLATION
------------

	perl Makefile.PL
